# Project "Health Outcomes Related to Air Quality and Economic factors in New York City" 
For this project, we examined the relationships between air quality and neighbourhood poverty, and checked what effect this has on cancer rates and incidents of asthma in New York City.  <br>
The 4 open-source datasets were taken from ["the New York City Department of Health Environment and Health Data Portal from the New York City government website"](https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/beta/). The main idea of this project is to master **SQL language with help of Python**. <br>
*Quiding questions:*
1. By looking at different areas of New York City, can we conclude in general a poor neighbourhood has higher cancer rate and worse air quality?
2. Which pollutants have the highest correlations with which cancers?
3. Does poor air quality increase the prevalence of asthma in adults? Does the borough in NYC affect this? Which pollutants has the greatest effect on asthma incidents?
4. Do the poorest neighbourhoods have the highest incidents of asthma among adults?<br> <br>
