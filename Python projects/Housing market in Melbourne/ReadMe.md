# Project "Data visualization: Housing market in Melbourne" 
For this project, the database [“Melbourne housing snapshot”](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dansbecker/melbourne-housing-snapshot?resource=download) was used, it was created by Tony Pino and posted in Kaggle for public use and research. The data was collected between January 28, 2016, and September 23, 2017. <br> <br>
*Quiding questions:*
1. Is there a relationship between housing prices in Melbourne and the distance of a house from Melbourne’s CBD?
2. How do housing prices vary between different regions of Melbourne?
3. How do different features of a house – such as the year it was built, its number of parking spots, and its number of bedrooms – reflect the price?
4. In what month(s) and season(s) of the year are real estate prices highest and lowest? <br>
In order to answer on these questions the following libraries and manipulations were implemented:
- numpy, pandas and math for data gathering, wrangling and cleaning;
- geopandas and folium for interactive map visualization;
- matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn and plotly.express for data visuatization;
- sklearn.linear_model for Linear model price prediction. <br> <br>
