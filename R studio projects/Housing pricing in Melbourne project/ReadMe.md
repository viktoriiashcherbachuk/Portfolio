# Project "Statistician analysis: Housing market in Melbourne"
For this project, the database [“Melbourne housing snapshot”](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dansbecker/melbourne-housing-snapshot?resource=download) was used, it was created by Tony Pino and posted in Kaggle for public use and research. The data was collected between January 28, 2016, and September 23, 2017. <br> <br>
*Topics to inverstigate:*
1. There is a negative correlation between housing prices and the distance of a property from Melbourne’s central business district area.
2. The different features of a house are related to the price of the property.
3. There is a difference in housing prices between the ‘Metropolitan’ (city area) and ‘Victoria’ (suburbs) regions of Melbourne. <br> <br>
In order to answer on these questions the several steps and knowledge of statistics were conducted such as data wrangling and cleaning (removing missing values and outliers), data visualization (ggplot2 library), linear regression models, correlation map,permutation tests, t.test and boostraping.<br> <br>
