# Portfolio by Viktoriia Shcherbachuk
These projects were made during my education in the Master's program ["Data Science and Analytics"](https://science.ucalgary.ca/data-science) at the University of Calgary. <br>

R studio project:
- ["Statistician analysis: Housing market in Melbourne"](https://github.com/viktoriiashcherbachuk/Portfolio/blob/main/R%20studio%20projects/Housing%20pricing%20in%20Melbourne%20project/Housing%20market%20in%20Melbourne.html) <br>
For this project, the database [“Melbourne housing snapshot”](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dansbecker/melbourne-housing-snapshot?resource=download) was used, it was created by Tony Pino and posted in Kaggle for public use and research. The data was collected between January 28, 2016, and September 23, 2017. <br> <br>
*Topics to inverstigate:*
1. There is a negative correlation between housing prices and the distance of a property from Melbourne’s central business district area.
2. The different features of a house are related to the price of the property.
3. There is a difference in housing prices between the ‘Metropolitan’ (city area) and ‘Victoria’ (suburbs) regions of Melbourne. <br> <br>
During this project, the knowledge from the course Data-602 "Statistical Data Analysis" was implemented.
<br>

Python project:
- ["Data visualization: Housing market in Melbourne"](https://github.com/viktoriiashcherbachuk/Portfolio/blob/main/Python%20projects/Housing%20market%20in%20Melbourne/Housing%20market%20in%20Melbourne_without%20map.ipynb) <br>
For this project, the database [“Melbourne housing snapshot”](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dansbecker/melbourne-housing-snapshot?resource=download) was used, it was created by Tony Pino and posted in Kaggle for public use and research. The data was collected between January 28, 2016, and September 23, 2017. <br> <br>
*Quiding questions:*
1. Is there a relationship between housing prices in Melbourne and the distance of a house from Melbourne’s CBD?
2. How do housing prices vary between different regions of Melbourne?
3. How do different features of a house – such as the year it was built, its number of parking spots, and its number of bedrooms – reflect the price?
4. In what month(s) and season(s) of the year are real estate prices highest and lowest? <br> <br>
During this project, the knowledge from the course Data-601 "Working with Data and Visualization" was implemented.

Because of the weight of the file project [the interactive map of Melbourne](https://github.com/viktoriiashcherbachuk/Portfolio/blob/main/Python%20projects/Housing%20market%20in%20Melbourne/Interactive%20map%20of%20Melbourne.ipynb) was created in a separate file.
