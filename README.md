These projects have been made during the education in the Master program ["Data Science and Analytics"](https://science.ucalgary.ca/data-science) at the University of Calgary. <br>

R studio project:
- ["Statistician analysis: Housing market in Melbourne"](https://github.com/viktoriiashcherbachuk/Portfolio/blob/main/R%20studio%20projects/Housing%20pricing%20in%20Melbourne%20project/Housing%20market%20in%20Melbourne.html) <br>
For this project, the database [“Melbourne housing snapshot”](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dansbecker/melbourne-housing-snapshot?resource=download) was used, it was created by Tony Pino and posted in Kaggle for public use and research. The data was collected between January 28, 2016, and September 23, 2017. <br> <br>
*Topics to inverstigate:*
1. There is a negative correlation between housing prices and the distance of a property from Melbourne’s central business district area.
2. The different features of a house are related to the price of the property.
3. There is a difference in housing prices between the ‘Metropolitan’ (city area) and ‘Victoria’ (suburbs) regions of Melbourne. <br> <br>
During this project, the knowledge from the course Data-602 "Statistical Data Analysis" was implemented.
