# Portfolio by Viktoriia Shcherbachuk
These projects were made during my education in the Master's program ["Data Science and Analytics"](https://science.ucalgary.ca/data-science) at the University of Calgary. <br>

R studio project:
- ["Multiple Regression Analysis: Prediction of Average Overall Achievement Score of schools in North Carolina"] (https://github.com/viktoriiashcherbachuk/Portfolio/blob/main/R%20studio%20projects/Overall%20Achievement%20Score%20of%20schools%20in%20North%20Carolina/Final-Project-Report-Data-603_Group3.pdf) <br>
For this project, the database [“School Report Cards (SRC)”](https://www.dpi.nc.gov/data-reports/school-report-cards/school-report-card-resources-researchers) was taken from the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction.
School level factors were taken into consideration in order to see how they are affecting the Overall Achievement Score of students at schools. <br> <br>
The best interaction model has been built for the prediction. Data cleaning and wrangling have been conducted as well as the individual t-test, stepwise regression procedure, F-test and multiple regression assumptions have been checked. <br> <br>

- ["Statistician analysis: Housing market in Melbourne"](https://github.com/viktoriiashcherbachuk/Portfolio/blob/main/R%20studio%20projects/Housing%20market%20in%20Melbourne%20project/Housing%20market%20in%20Melbourne.pdf) <br>
For this project, the database [“Melbourne housing snapshot”](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dansbecker/melbourne-housing-snapshot?resource=download) was used, it was created by Tony Pino and posted in Kaggle for public use and research. The data was collected between January 28, 2016, and September 23, 2017. <br> <br>
*Topics to inverstigate:*
1. There is a negative correlation between housing prices and the distance of a property from Melbourne’s central business district area.
2. The different features of a house are related to the price of the property.
3. There is a difference in housing prices between the ‘Metropolitan’ (city area) and ‘Victoria’ (suburbs) regions of Melbourne. <br> <br>
During this project, the knowledge from the course Data-602 "Statistical Data Analysis" was implemented.
<br>

Python project:
- [""Health Outcomes Related to Air Quality and Economic factors in New York City""] (https://github.com/viktoriiashcherbachuk/Portfolio/blob/main/Python%20projects/Health%20Outcomes%20In%20New%20York%20City/Health%20Outcomes%20in%20NYC.ipynb) <br>
For this project, we examined the relationships between air quality and neighbourhood poverty, and checked what effect this has on cancer rates and incidents of asthma in New York City.  <br>
The 4 open-source datasets were taken from ["the New York City Department of Health Environment and Health Data Portal from the New York City government website"](https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/beta/). The main idea of this project was to master **SQL language with help of Python**. <br>
*Quiding questions:*
1. By looking at different areas of New York City, can we conclude in general a poor neighbourhood has higher cancer rate and worse air quality?
2. Which pollutants have the highest correlations with which cancers?
3. Does poor air quality increase the prevalence of asthma in adults? Does the borough in NYC affect this? Which pollutants has the greatest effect on asthma incidents?
4. Do the poorest neighbourhoods have the highest incidents of asthma among adults?<br> <br>

- ["Data visualization: Housing market in Melbourne"](https://github.com/viktoriiashcherbachuk/Portfolio/blob/main/Python%20projects/Housing%20market%20in%20Melbourne/Housing%20market%20in%20Melbourne_without%20map.ipynb) <br>
For this project, the database [“Melbourne housing snapshot”](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dansbecker/melbourne-housing-snapshot?resource=download) was used, it was created by Tony Pino and posted in Kaggle for public use and research. The data was collected between January 28, 2016, and September 23, 2017. <br> <br>
*Quiding questions:*
1. Is there a relationship between housing prices in Melbourne and the distance of a house from Melbourne’s CBD?
2. How do housing prices vary between different regions of Melbourne?
3. How do different features of a house – such as the year it was built, its number of parking spots, and its number of bedrooms – reflect the price?
4. In what month(s) and season(s) of the year are real estate prices highest and lowest? <br> <br>
During this project, the knowledge from the course Data-601 "Working with Data and Visualization" was implemented.

Because of the weight of the file project [the interactive map of Melbourne](https://github.com/viktoriiashcherbachuk/Portfolio/blob/main/Python%20projects/Housing%20market%20in%20Melbourne/Interactive%20map%20of%20Melbourne.ipynb) was created in a separate file. However, the size of the file is huge. Therefore, it is recommended to download the file to see the map.
